Gatus is a developer-oriented health dashboard that gives you the ability to monitor your services using HTTP, ICMP, TCP, and even DNS
queries as well as evaluate the result of said queries by using a list of conditions on values like the status code,
the response time, the certificate expiration, the body and many others. The icing on top is that each of these health
checks can be paired with alerting via Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Twilio and many more.

I personally deploy it in my Kubernetes cluster and let it monitor the status of my
core applications: https://status.twin.sh/

## Why Gatus?
Before getting into the specifics, I want to address the most common question:
> Why would I use Gatus when I can just use Prometheus’ Alertmanager, Cloudwatch or even Splunk?

Neither of these can tell you that there’s a problem if there are no clients actively calling the endpoint.
In other words, it's because monitoring metrics mostly rely on existing traffic, which effectively means that unless
your clients are already experiencing a problem, you won't be notified.

Gatus, on the other hand, allows you to configure health checks for each of your features, which in turn allows it to
monitor these features and potentially alert you before any clients are impacted.

A sign you may want to look into Gatus is by simply asking yourself whether you'd receive an alert if your load balancer
was to go down right now. Will any of your existing alerts be triggered? Your metrics won’t report an increase in errors
if no traffic makes it to your applications. This puts you in a situation where your clients are the ones
that will notify you about the degradation of your services rather than you reassuring them that you're working on
fixing the issue before they even know about it.

## Features
The main features of Gatus are:

- **Highly flexible health check conditions**: While checking the response status may be enough for some use cases, Gatus goes much further and allows you to add conditions on the response time, the response body and even the IP address.
- **Ability to use Gatus for user acceptance tests**: Thanks to the point above, you can leverage this application to create automated user acceptance tests.
- **Very easy to configure**: Not only is the configuration designed to be as readable as possible, it's also extremely easy to add a new service or a new endpoint to monitor.
- **Alerting**: While having a pretty visual dashboard is useful to keep track of the state of your application(s), you probably don't want to stare at it all day. Thus, notifications via Slack, Mattermost, Messagebird, PagerDuty, Twilio, Google chat and Teams are supported out of the box with the ability to configure a custom alerting provider for any needs you might have, whether it be a different provider or a custom application that manages automated rollbacks.
- **Metrics**
- **Low resource consumption**: As with most Go applications, the resource footprint that this application requires is negligibly small.

## Usage

<details>
  <summary><b>Quick start</b></summary>

```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus twinproduction/gatus
```
You can also use GitHub Container Registry if you prefer:
```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus ghcr.io/twin/gatus
```
If you want to create your own configuration, see [Docker](#docker) for information on how to mount a configuration file.
</details>

Here's a simple example:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: website                 # Name of your endpoint, can be anything
    url: "https://twin.sh/health"
    interval: 5m                  # Duration to wait between every status check (default: 60s)
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"         # Status must be 200
      - "[BODY].status == UP"     # The json path "$.status" must be equal to UP
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"   # Response time must be under 300ms

  - name: make-sure-header-is-rendered
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 60s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"                          # Status must be 200
      - "[BODY] == pat(*<h1>Example Domain</h1>*)" # Body must contain the specified header
```

This example would look similar to this:

![Simple example](.github/assets/example.png)

By default, the configuration file is expected to be at `config/config.yaml`.

You can specify a custom path by setting the `GATUS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

If `GATUS_CONFIG_PATH` points to a directory, all `*.yaml` and `*.yml` files inside said directory and its
subdirectories are merged like so:
- All maps/objects are deep merged (i.e. you could define `alerting.slack` in one file and `alerting.pagerduty` in another file)
- All slices/arrays are appended (i.e. you can define `endpoints` in multiple files and each endpoint will be added to the final list of endpoints)
- Parameters with a primitive value (e.g. `debug`, `metrics`, `alerting.slack.webhook-url`, etc.) may only be defined once to forcefully avoid any ambiguity
    - To clarify, this also means that you could not define `alerting.slack.webhook-url` in two files with different values. All files are merged into one before they are processed. This is by design.

> 💡 You can also use environment variables in the configuration file (e.g. `$DOMAIN`, `${DOMAIN}`)
>
> See [examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage/config/config.yaml](.examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage/config/config.yaml) for an example.

|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `len`    | If the given path leads to an array, returns its length. Otherwise, the JSON at the given path is minified and converted to a string, and the resulting number of characters is returned. Works only with the `[BODY]` placeholder. | `len([BODY].username) > 8`         |
| `has`    | Returns `true` or `false` based on whether a given path is valid. Works only with the `[BODY]` placeholder.                                                                                                                         | `has([BODY].errors) == false`      |
| `pat`    | Specifies that the string passed as parameter should be evaluated as a pattern. Works only with `==` and `!=`.                                                                                                                      | `[IP] == pat(192.168.*)`           |
| `any`    | Specifies that any one of the values passed as parameters is a valid value. Works only with `==` and `!=`.                                                                                                                          | `[BODY].ip == any(127.0.0.1, ::1)` |

> 💡 Use `pat` only when you need to. `[STATUS] == pat(2*)` is a lot more expensive than `[STATUS] < 300`.

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                        | Default    |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|
| `storage`         | Storage configuration                                                                                                                              | `{}`       |
| `storage.path`    | Path to persist the data in. Only supported for types `sqlite` and `postgres`.                                                                     | `""`       |
| `storage.type`    | Type of storage. Valid types: `memory`, `sqlite`, `postgres`.                                                                                      | `"memory"` |
| `storage.caching` | Whether to use write-through caching. Improves loading time for large dashboards. <br />Only supported if `storage.type` is `sqlite` or `postgres` | `false`    |

The results for each endpoint health check as well as the data for uptime and the past events must be persisted
so that they can be displayed on the dashboard. These parameters allow you to configure the storage in question.

- If `storage.type` is `memory` (default):
```yaml
# Note that this is the default value, and you can omit the storage configuration altogether to achieve the same result.
# Because the data is stored in memory, the data will not survive a restart.
storage:
  type: memory
```
- If `storage.type` is `sqlite`, `storage.path` must not be blank:
```yaml
storage:
  type: sqlite
  path: data.db
```
See [examples/docker-compose-sqlite-storage](.examples/docker-compose-sqlite-storage) for an example.

- If `storage.type` is `postgres`, `storage.path` must be the connection URL:
```yaml
storage:
  type: postgres
  path: "postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/gatus?sslmode=disable"
```
See [examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage](.examples/docker-compose-postgres-storage) for an example.


### Client configuration
In order to support a wide range of environments, each monitored endpoint has a unique configuration for
the client used to send the request.

| Parameter                              | Description                                                                 | Default         |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------- |

| `client.timeout`                       | Duration before timing out.                                                 | `10s`           |
| `client.dns-resolver`                  | Override the DNS resolver using the format `{proto}://{host}:{port}`.       | `""`            |
| `client.oauth2`                        | OAuth2 client configuration.                                                | `{}`            |
| `client.oauth2.token-url`              | The token endpoint URL                                                      | required `""`   |
| `client.oauth2.client-id`              | The client id which should be used for the `Client credentials flow`        | required `""`   |
| `client.oauth2.client-secret`          | The client secret which should be used for the `Client credentials flow`    | required `""`   |
| `client.oauth2.scopes[]`               | A list of `scopes` which should be used for the `Client credentials flow`.  | required `[""]` |
| `client.proxy-url`                     | The URL of the proxy to use for the client                                  | `""`            |
| `client.identity-aware-proxy`          | Google Identity-Aware-Proxy client configuration.                           | `{}`            |
| `client.identity-aware-proxy.audience` | The Identity-Aware-Proxy audience. (client-id of the IAP oauth2 credential) | required `""`   |
| `client.tls.certificate-file`          | Path to a client certificate (in PEM format) for mTLS configurations.       | `""`            |
| `client.tls.private-key-file`          | Path to a client private key (in PEM format) for mTLS configurations.       | `""`            |
| `client.tls.renegotiation`             | Type of renegotiation support to provide. (`never`, `freely`, `once`).      | `"never"`       |
| `client.network`                       | The network to use for ICMP endpoint client (`ip`, `ip4` or `ip6`).         | `"ip"`          |


> 📝 Some of these parameters are ignored based on the type of endpoint. For instance, there's no certificate involved
in ICMP requests (ping), therefore, setting `client.insecure` to `true` for an endpoint of that type will not do anything.

This default configuration is as follows:

```yaml
client:
  insecure: false
  ignore-redirect: false
  timeout: 10s
```

Note that this configuration is only available under `endpoints[]`, `alerting.mattermost` and `alerting.custom`.

Here's an example with the client configuration under `endpoints[]`:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: website
    url: "https://twin.sh/health"
    client:
      insecure: false
      ignore-redirect: false
      timeout: 10s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

This example shows how you can specify a custom DNS resolver:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: with-custom-dns-resolver
    url: "https://your.health.api/health"
    client:
      dns-resolver: "tcp://8.8.8.8:53"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

This example shows how you can use the `client.oauth2` configuration to query a backend API with `Bearer token`:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: with-custom-oauth2
    url: "https://your.health.api/health"
    client:
      oauth2:
        token-url: https://your-token-server/token
        client-id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        client-secret: your-client-secret
        scopes: ['https://your.health.api/.default']
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

This example shows how you can use the `client.identity-aware-proxy` configuration to query a backend API with `Bearer token` using Google Identity-Aware-Proxy:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: with-custom-iap
    url: "https://my.iap.protected.app/health"
    client:
      identity-aware-proxy:
        audience: "XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

> 📝 Note that Gatus will use the [gcloud default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) within its environment to generate the token.

This example shows you how you cna use the `client.tls` configuration to perform an mTLS query to a backend API:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: website
    url: "https://your.mtls.protected.app/health"
    client:
      tls:
        certificate-file: /path/to/user_cert.pem
        private-key-file: /path/to/user_key.pem
        renegotiation: once
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```
> 📝 Note that if running in a container, you must volume mount the certificate and key into the container.

### Alerting
Gatus supports multiple alerting providers, such as Slack and PagerDuty, and supports different alerts for each
individual endpoints with configurable descriptions and thresholds.

> 📝 If an alerting provider is not properly configured, all alerts configured with the provider's type will be
ignored.

The GitHub alerting provider creates an issue prefixed with `alert(gatus):` and suffixed with the endpoint's display
name for each alert. If `send-on-resolved` is set to `true` on the endpoint alert, the issue will be automatically
closed when the alert is resolved.

The GitLab alerting provider creates an alert prefixed with `alert(gatus):` and suffixed with the endpoint's display
name for each alert. If `send-on-resolved` is set to `true` on the endpoint alert, the alert will be automatically
closed when the alert is resolved. See
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/integrations.html#configuration to configure the endpoint.

It is highly recommended to set `endpoints[].alerts[].send-on-resolved` to `true` for alerts
of type `pagerduty`, because unlike other alerts, the operation resulting from setting said
parameter to `true` will not create another incident but mark the incident as resolved on
PagerDuty instead.

Behavior:
- By default, `alerting.pagerduty.integration-key` is used as the integration key
- If the endpoint being evaluated belongs to a group (`endpoints[].group`) matching the value of `alerting.pagerduty.overrides[].group`, the provider will use that override's integration key instead of `alerting.pagerduty.integration-key`'s

```yaml
alerting:
  pagerduty:
    integration-key: "********************************"
    # You can also add group-specific integration keys, which will
    # override the integration key above for the specified groups
    overrides:
      - group: "core"
        integration-key: "********************************"

endpoints:
  - name: website
    url: "https://twin.sh/health"

      - "[STATUS] == 200"

While they're called alerts, you can use this feature to call anything.

For instance, you could automate rollbacks by having an application that keeps tracks of new deployments, and by
leveraging Gatus, you could have Gatus call that application endpoint when an endpoint starts failing. Your application
would then check if the endpoint that started failing was part of the recently deployed application, and if it was,
then automatically roll it back.

Furthermore, you may use the following placeholders in the body (`alerting.custom.body`) and in the url (`alerting.custom.url`):
- `[ALERT_DESCRIPTION]` (resolved from `endpoints[].alerts[].description`)
- `[ENDPOINT_NAME]` (resolved from `endpoints[].name`)
- `[ENDPOINT_GROUP]` (resolved from `endpoints[].group`)
- `[ENDPOINT_URL]` (resolved from `endpoints[].url`)

If you have an alert using the `custom` provider with `send-on-resolved` set to `true`, you can use the
`[ALERT_TRIGGERED_OR_RESOLVED]` placeholder to differentiate the notifications.
The aforementioned placeholder will be replaced by `TRIGGERED` or `RESOLVED` accordingly, though it can be modified
(details at the end of this section).

For all intents and purposes, we'll configure the custom alert with a Slack webhook, but you can call anything you want.
```yaml
alerting:
  custom:
    url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/**********/**********/**********"
    method: "POST"
    body: |
      {
        "text": "[ALERT_TRIGGERED_OR_RESOLVED]: [ENDPOINT_GROUP] - [ENDPOINT_NAME] - [ALERT_DESCRIPTION]"
      }
endpoints:
  - name: website
    url: "https://twin.sh/health"
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].status == UP"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"
    alerts:
      - type: custom
        failure-threshold: 10
        success-threshold: 3
        send-on-resolved: true
        description: "health check failed"
```

Note that you can customize the resolved values for the `[ALERT_TRIGGERED_OR_RESOLVED]` placeholder like so:
```yaml
alerting:
  custom:
    placeholders:
      ALERT_TRIGGERED_OR_RESOLVED:
        TRIGGERED: "partial_outage"
        RESOLVED: "operational"
```
As a result, the `[ALERT_TRIGGERED_OR_RESOLVED]` in the body of first example of this section would be replaced by
`partial_outage` when an alert is triggered and `operational` when an alert is resolved.


#### Setting a default alert
| Parameter                                    | Description                                                                   | Default |
|:---------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|
| `alerting.*.default-alert.enabled`           | Whether to enable the alert                                                   | N/A     |
| `alerting.*.default-alert.failure-threshold` | Number of failures in a row needed before triggering the alert                | N/A     |
| `alerting.*.default-alert.success-threshold` | Number of successes in a row before an ongoing incident is marked as resolved | N/A     |
| `alerting.*.default-alert.send-on-resolved`  | Whether to send a notification once a triggered alert is marked as resolved   | N/A     |
| `alerting.*.default-alert.description`       | Description of the alert. Will be included in the alert sent                  | N/A     |

> ⚠ You must still specify the `type` of the alert in the endpoint configuration even if you set the default alert of a provider.

While you can specify the alert configuration directly in the endpoint definition, it's tedious and may lead to a very
long configuration file.

To avoid such problem, you can use the `default-alert` parameter present in each provider configuration:
```yaml
alerting:
  slack:
    webhook-url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/**********/**********/**********"
    default-alert:
      description: "health check failed"
      send-on-resolved: true
      failure-threshold: 5
      success-threshold: 5
```

As a result, your Gatus configuration looks a lot tidier:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: example
    url: "https://example.org"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
    alerts:
      - type: slack

  - name: other-example
    url: "https://example.com"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
    alerts:
      - type: slack
```

It also allows you to do things like this:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: example
    url: "https://example.org"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
    alerts:
      - type: slack
        failure-threshold: 5
      - type: slack
        failure-threshold: 10
      - type: slack
        failure-threshold: 15
```

Of course, you can also mix alert types:
```yaml
alerting:
  slack:
    webhook-url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/**********/**********/**********"
    default-alert:
      failure-threshold: 3
  pagerduty:
    integration-key: "********************************"
    default-alert:
      failure-threshold: 5

endpoints:
  - name: endpoint-1
    url: "https://example.org"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
    alerts:
      - type: slack
      - type: pagerduty

  - name: endpoint-2
    url: "https://example.org"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
    alerts:
      - type: slack
      - type: pagerduty
```


### Maintenance
If you have maintenance windows, you may not want to be annoyed by alerts.
To do that, you'll have to use the maintenance configuration:

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                            | Default       |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `maintenance.enabled`  | Whether the maintenance period is enabled                                                                                              | `true`        |
| `maintenance.start`    | Time at which the maintenance window starts in `hh:mm` format (e.g. `23:00`)                                                           | Required `""` |
| `maintenance.duration` | Duration of the maintenance window (e.g. `1h`, `30m`)                                                                                  | Required `""` |
| `maintenance.every`    | Days on which the maintenance period applies (e.g. `[Monday, Thursday]`).<br />If left empty, the maintenance window applies every day | `[]`          |

> 📝 The maintenance configuration uses UTC

Here's an example:
```yaml
maintenance:
  start: 23:00
  duration: 1h
  every: [Monday, Thursday]
```
Note that you can also specify each day on separate lines:
```yaml
maintenance:
  start: 23:00
  duration: 1h
  every:
    - Monday
    - Thursday
```


### Security
| Parameter        | Description                  | Default |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|:--------|
| `security`       | Security configuration       | `{}`    |
| `security.basic` | HTTP Basic configuration     | `{}`    |
| `security.oidc`  | OpenID Connect configuration | `{}`    |


#### Basic Authentication
| Parameter                               | Description                                                                        | Default       |
|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `security.basic`                        | HTTP Basic configuration                                                           | `{}`          |
| `security.basic.username`               | Username for Basic authentication.                                                 | Required `""` |
| `security.basic.password-bcrypt-base64` | Password hashed with Bcrypt and then encoded with base64 for Basic authentication. | Required `""` |

The example below will require that you authenticate with the username `john.doe` and the password `hunter2`:
```yaml
security:
  basic:
    username: "john.doe"
    password-bcrypt-base64: "JDJhJDEwJHRiMnRFakxWazZLdXBzRERQazB1TE8vckRLY05Yb1hSdnoxWU0yQ1FaYXZRSW1McmladDYu"
```

> ⚠ Make sure to carefully select to cost of the bcrypt hash. The higher the cost, the longer it takes to compute the hash,
and basic auth verifies the password against the hash on every request. As of 2023-01-06, I suggest a cost of 9.


#### OIDC
| Parameter                        | Description                                                    | Default       |
|:---------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `security.oidc`                  | OpenID Connect configuration                                   | `{}`          |
| `security.oidc.issuer-url`       | Issuer URL                                                     | Required `""` |
| `security.oidc.redirect-url`     | Redirect URL. Must end with `/authorization-code/callback`     | Required `""` |
| `security.oidc.client-id`        | Client id                                                      | Required `""` |
| `security.oidc.client-secret`    | Client secret                                                  | Required `""` |
| `security.oidc.scopes`           | Scopes to request. The only scope you need is `openid`.        | Required `[]` |
| `security.oidc.allowed-subjects` | List of subjects to allow. If empty, all subjects are allowed. | `[]`          |

```yaml
security:
  oidc:
    issuer-url: "https://example.okta.com"
    redirect-url: "https://status.example.com/authorization-code/callback"
    client-id: "123456789"
    client-secret: "abcdefghijk"
    scopes: ["openid"]
    # You may optionally specify a list of allowed subjects. If this is not specified, all subjects will be allowed.
    #allowed-subjects: ["johndoe@example.com"]
```

### TLS Encryption
Gatus supports basic encryption with TLS. To enable this, certificate files in PEM format have to be provided.

The example below shows an example configuration which makes gatus respond on port 4443 to HTTPS requests:
```yaml
web:
  port: 4443
  tls:
    certificate-file: "certificate.crt"
    private-key-file: "private.key"
```

### Metrics
To enable metrics, you must set `metrics` to `true`. Doing so will expose Prometheus-friendly metrics at the `/metrics`
endpoint on the same port your application is configured to run on (`web.port`).

| Metric name                                  | Type    | Description                                                                | Labels                          | Relevant endpoint types |
|:---------------------------------------------|:--------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------------|
| gatus_results_total                          | counter | Number of results per endpoint                                             | key, group, name, type, success | All                     |
| gatus_results_code_total                     | counter | Total number of results by code                                            | key, group, name, type, code    | DNS, HTTP               |
| gatus_results_connected_total                | counter | Total number of results in which a connection was successfully established | key, group, name, type          | All                     |
| gatus_results_duration_seconds               | gauge   | Duration of the request in seconds                                         | key, group, name, type          | All                     |
| gatus_results_certificate_expiration_seconds | gauge   | Number of seconds until the certificate expires                            | key, group, name, type          | HTTP, STARTTLS          |

See [examples/docker-compose-grafana-prometheus](.examples/docker-compose-grafana-prometheus) for further documentation as well as an example.


### Connectivity
| Parameter                       | Description                                | Default       |
|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `connectivity`                  | Connectivity configuration                 | `{}`          |
| `connectivity.checker`          | Connectivity checker configuration         | Required `{}` |
| `connectivity.checker.target`   | Host to use for validating connectivity    | Required `""` |
| `connectivity.checker.interval` | Interval at which to validate connectivity | `1m`          |

While Gatus is used to monitor other services, it is possible for Gatus itself to lose connectivity to the internet.
In order to prevent Gatus from reporting endpoints as unhealthy when Gatus itself is unhealthy, you may configure
Gatus to periodically check for internet connectivity.

All endpoint executions are skipped while the connectivity checker deems connectivity to be down.

```yaml
connectivity:
  checker:
    target: 1.1.1.1:53
    interval: 60s
```


### Remote instances (EXPERIMENTAL)
This feature allows you to retrieve endpoint statuses from a remote Gatus instance.

There are two main use cases for this:
- You have multiple Gatus instances running on different machines, and you wish to visually expose the statuses through a single dashboard
- You have one or more Gatus instances that are not publicly accessible (e.g. behind a firewall), and you wish to retrieve

This is an experimental feature. It may be removed or updated in a breaking manner at any time. Furthermore,
there are known issues with this feature. If you'd like to provide some feedback, please write a comment in [#64](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus/issues/64).
Use at your own risk.

| Parameter                          | Description                                  | Default       |
|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `remote`                           | Remote configuration                         | `{}`          |
| `remote.instances`                 | List of remote instances                     | Required `[]` |
| `remote.instances.endpoint-prefix` | String to prefix all endpoint names with     | `""`          |
| `remote.instances.url`             | URL from which to retrieve endpoint statuses | Required `""` |

```yaml
remote:
  instances:
    - endpoint-prefix: "status.example.org-"
      url: "https://status.example.org/api/v1/endpoints/statuses"
```


## Deployment
Many examples can be found in the [.examples](.examples) folder, but this section will focus on the most popular ways of deploying Gatus.


### Docker
To run Gatus locally with Docker:
```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus twinproduction/gatus
```

Other than using one of the examples provided in the [.examples](.examples) folder, you can also try it out locally by
creating a configuration file, we'll call it `config.yaml` for this example, and running the following
command:
```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/config.yaml,target=/config/config.yaml --name gatus twinproduction/gatus
```

If you're on Windows, replace `"$(pwd)"` by the absolute path to your current directory, e.g.:
```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 --mount type=bind,source=C:/Users/Chris/Desktop/config.yaml,target=/config/config.yaml --name gatus twinproduction/gatus
```

To build the image locally:
```console
docker build . -t twinproduction/gatus
```


### Helm Chart
[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the chart.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repository as follows:

```console
helm repo add minicloudlabs https://minicloudlabs.github.io/helm-charts
```

To get more details, please check [chart's configuration](https://github.com/minicloudlabs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/gatus#configuration)
and [helmfile example](https://github.com/minicloudlabs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/gatus#helmfileyaml-example)


### Terraform
Gatus can be deployed on Terraform by using the following module: [terraform-kubernetes-gatus](https://github.com/TwiN/terraform-kubernetes-gatus).


## Running the tests
```console
go test -v ./...
```


## Using in Production
See the [Deployment](#deployment) section.


## FAQ
### Sending a GraphQL request
By setting `endpoints[].graphql` to true, the body will automatically be wrapped by the standard GraphQL `query` parameter.

For instance, the following configuration:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: filter-users-by-gender
    url: http://localhost:8080/playground
    method: POST
    graphql: true
    body: |
      {
        users(gender: "female") {
          id
          name
          gender
          avatar
        }
      }
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].data.users[0].gender == female"
```

will send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8080/playground` with the following body:
```json
{"query":"      {\n        users(gender: \"female\") {\n          id\n          name\n          gender\n          avatar\n        }\n      }"}
```


### Recommended interval
> 📝 This does not apply if `disable-monitoring-lock` is set to `true`, as the monitoring lock is what
> tells Gatus to only evaluate one endpoint at a time.

To ensure that Gatus provides reliable and accurate results (i.e. response time), Gatus only evaluates one endpoint at a time
In other words, even if you have multiple endpoints with the same interval, they will not execute at the same time.

You can test this yourself by running Gatus with several endpoints configured with a very short, unrealistic interval,
such as 1ms. You'll notice that the response time does not fluctuate - that is because while endpoints are evaluated on
different goroutines, there's a global lock that prevents multiple endpoints from running at the same time.

Unfortunately, there is a drawback. If you have a lot of endpoints, including some that are very slow or prone to timing out
(the default timeout is 10s), then it means that for the entire duration of the request, no other endpoint can be evaluated.

The interval does not include the duration of the request itself, which means that if an endpoint has an interval of 30s
and the request takes 2s to complete, the timestamp between two evaluations will be 32s, not 30s.

While this does not prevent Gatus' from performing health checks on all other endpoints, it may cause Gatus to be unable
to respect the configured interval, for instance:
- Endpoint A has an interval of 5s, and times out after 10s to complete
- Endpoint B has an interval of 5s, and takes 1ms to complete
- Endpoint B will be unable to run every 5s, because endpoint A's health evaluation takes longer than its interval

To sum it up, while Gatus can handle any interval you throw at it, you're better off having slow requests with
higher interval.

As a rule of thumb, I personally set the interval for more complex health checks to `5m` (5 minutes) and
simple health checks used for alerting (PagerDuty/Twilio) to `30s`.


### Default timeouts
| Endpoint type | Timeout |
|:--------------|:--------|
| HTTP          | 10s     |
| TCP           | 10s     |
| ICMP          | 10s     |

To modify the timeout, see [Client configuration](#client-configuration).


### Monitoring a TCP endpoint
By prefixing `endpoints[].url` with `tcp:\\`, you can monitor TCP endpoints at a very basic level:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: redis
    url: "tcp://127.0.0.1:6379"
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
```

Placeholders `[STATUS]` and `[BODY]` as well as the fields `endpoints[].body`, `endpoints[].headers`,
`endpoints[].method` and `endpoints[].graphql` are not supported for TCP endpoints.

This works for applications such as databases (Postgres, MySQL, etc.) and caches (Redis, Memcached, etc.).

> 📝 `[CONNECTED] == true` does not guarantee that the endpoint itself is healthy - it only guarantees that there's
something at the given address listening to the given port, and that a connection to that address was successfully
established.

### Monitoring a UDP endpoint
By prefixing `endpoints[].url` with `udp:\\`, you can monitor UDP endpoints at a very basic level:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: example
    url: "udp://example.org:80"
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
```

Placeholders `[STATUS]` and `[BODY]` as well as the fields `endpoints[].body`, `endpoints[].headers`,
`endpoints[].method` and `endpoints[].graphql` are not supported for UDP endpoints.

This works for UDP based application.

### Monitoring a SCTP endpoint
By prefixing `endpoints[].url` with `sctp:\\`, you can monitor Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) endpoints at a very basic level:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: example
    url: "sctp://127.0.0.1:38412"
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
```

Placeholders `[STATUS]` and `[BODY]` as well as the fields `endpoints[].body`, `endpoints[].headers`,
`endpoints[].method` and `endpoints[].graphql` are not supported for SCTP endpoints.

This works for SCTP based application.

### Monitoring a WebSocket endpoint
By prefixing `endpoints[].url` with `ws://` or `wss://`, you can monitor WebSocket endpoints at a very basic level:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: example
    url: "wss://example.com/"
    body: "status"
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
      - "[BODY].result >= 0"
```

The `[BODY]` placeholder contains the output of the query, and `[CONNECTED]`
shows whether the connection was successfully established.

### Monitoring an endpoint using ICMP
By prefixing `endpoints[].url` with `icmp:\\`, you can monitor endpoints at a very basic level using ICMP, or more
commonly known as "ping" or "echo":

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: ping-example
    url: "icmp://example.com"
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
```

Only the placeholders `[CONNECTED]`, `[IP]` and `[RESPONSE_TIME]` are supported for endpoints of type ICMP.
You can specify a domain prefixed by `icmp://`, or an IP address prefixed by `icmp://`.

If you run Gatus on Linux, please read the Linux section on https://github.com/prometheus-community/pro-bing#linux
if you encounter any problems.

### Monitoring an endpoint using DNS queries
Defining a `dns` configuration in an endpoint will automatically mark said endpoint as an endpoint of type DNS:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: example-dns-query
    url: "8.8.8.8" # Address of the DNS server to use
    dns:
      query-name: "example.com"
      query-type: "A"
    conditions:
      - "[BODY] == 93.184.216.34"
      - "[DNS_RCODE] == NOERROR"
```

There are two placeholders that can be used in the conditions for endpoints of type DNS:
- The placeholder `[BODY]` resolves to the output of the query. For instance, a query of type `A` would return an IPv4.
- The placeholder `[DNS_RCODE]` resolves to the name associated to the response code returned by the query, such as
`NOERROR`, `FORMERR`, `SERVFAIL`, `NXDOMAIN`, etc.

### Monitoring an endpoint using SSH
You can monitor endpoints using SSH by prefixing `endpoints[].url` with `ssh:\\`:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: ssh-example
    url: "ssh://example.com:22" # port is optional. Default is 22.
    ssh:
      username: "username"
      password: "password"
    body: |
      {
        "command": "uptime"
      }
    interval: 1m
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
      - "[STATUS] == 0"
```

The following placeholders are supported for endpoints of type SSH:
- `[CONNECTED]` resolves to `true` if the SSH connection was successful, `false` otherwise
- `[STATUS]` resolves the exit code of the command executed on the remote server (e.g. `0` for success)

### Monitoring an endpoint using STARTTLS
If you have an email server that you want to ensure there are no problems with, monitoring it through STARTTLS
will serve as a good initial indicator:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: starttls-smtp-example
    url: "starttls://smtp.gmail.com:587"
    interval: 30m
    client:
      timeout: 5s
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
      - "[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] > 48h"
```

### Monitoring an endpoint using TLS
Monitoring endpoints using SSL/TLS encryption, such as LDAP over TLS, can help detect certificate expiration:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: tls-ldaps-example
    url: "tls://ldap.example.com:636"
    interval: 30m
    client:
      timeout: 5s
    conditions:
      - "[CONNECTED] == true"
      - "[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] > 48h"
```


### Monitoring domain expiration
You can monitor the expiration of a domain with all endpoint types except for DNS by using the `[DOMAIN_EXPIRATION]`
placeholder:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: check-domain-and-certificate-expiration
    url: "https://example.org"
    interval: 1h
    conditions:
      - "[DOMAIN_EXPIRATION] > 720h"
      - "[CERTIFICATE_EXPIRATION] > 240h"
```

> ⚠ The usage of the `[DOMAIN_EXPIRATION]` placeholder requires Gatus to send a request to the official IANA WHOIS service [through a library](https://github.com/TwiN/whois)
and in some cases, a secondary request to a TLD-specific WHOIS server (e.g. `whois.nic.sh`).
To prevent the WHOIS service from throttling your IP address if you send too many requests, Gatus will prevent you from
using the `[DOMAIN_EXPIRATION]` placeholder on an endpoint with an interval of less than `5m`.


### disable-monitoring-lock
Setting `disable-monitoring-lock` to `true` means that multiple endpoints could be monitored at the same time.

While this behavior wouldn't generally be harmful, conditions using the `[RESPONSE_TIME]` placeholder could be impacted
by the evaluation of multiple endpoints at the same time, therefore, the default value for this parameter is `false`.

There are three main reasons why you might want to disable the monitoring lock:
- You're using Gatus for load testing (each endpoint are periodically evaluated on a different goroutine, so
technically, if you create 100 endpoints with a 1 seconds interval, Gatus will send 100 requests per second)
- You have a _lot_ of endpoints to monitor
- You want to test multiple endpoints at very short intervals (< 5s)


### Reloading configuration on the fly
For the sake of convenience, Gatus automatically reloads the configuration on the fly if the loaded configuration file
is updated while Gatus is running.

By default, the application will exit if the updating configuration is invalid, but you can configure
Gatus to continue running if the configuration file is updated with an invalid configuration by
setting `skip-invalid-config-update` to `true`.

Keep in mind that it is in your best interest to ensure the validity of the configuration file after each update you
apply to the configuration file while Gatus is running by looking at the log and making sure that you do not see the
following message:
```
The configuration file was updated, but it is not valid. The old configuration will continue being used.
```
Failure to do so may result in Gatus being unable to start if the application is restarted for whatever reason.

I recommend not setting `skip-invalid-config-update` to `true` to avoid a situation like this, but the choice is yours
to make.

**If you are not using a file storage**, updating the configuration while Gatus is running is effectively
the same as restarting the application.

> 📝 Updates may not be detected if the config file is bound instead of the config folder. See [#151](https://github.com/TwiN/gatus/issues/151).


### Endpoint groups
Endpoint groups are used for grouping multiple endpoints together on the dashboard.

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: frontend
    group: core
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 5m
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"

  - name: backend
    group: core
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 5m
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"

  - name: monitoring
    group: internal
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 5m
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"

  - name: nas
    group: internal
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 5m
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"

  - name: random endpoint that is not part of a group
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 5m
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

The configuration above will result in a dashboard that looks like this:

### Exposing Gatus on a custom path
Currently, you can expose the Gatus UI using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) such as `status.example.org`. However, it does not support path-based routing, which means you cannot expose it through a URL like `example.org/status/`.

For more information, see https://github.com/TwiN/gatus/issues/88.


### Exposing Gatus on a custom port
By default, Gatus is exposed on port `8080`, but you may specify a different port by setting the `web.port` parameter:
```yaml
web:
  port: 8081
```

If you're using a PaaS like Heroku that doesn't let you set a custom port and exposes it through an environment
variable instead, you can use that environment variable directly in the configuration file:
```yaml
web:
  port: ${PORT}
```


### Configuring a startup delay
If, for any reason, you need Gatus to wait for a given amount of time before monitoring the endpoints on application start, you can use the `GATUS_DELAY_START_SECONDS` environment variable to make Gatus sleep on startup.


### Keeping your configuration small
While not specific to Gatus, you can leverage YAML anchors to create a default configuration.
If you have a large configuration file, this should help you keep things clean.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```yaml
default-endpoint: &defaults
  group: core
  interval: 5m
  client:
    insecure: true
    timeout: 30s
  conditions:
    - "[STATUS] == 200"

endpoints:
  - name: anchor-example-1
    <<: *defaults               # This will merge the configuration under &defaults with this endpoint
    url: "https://example.org"

  - name: anchor-example-2
    <<: *defaults
    group: example              # This will override the group defined in &defaults
    url: "https://example.com"

  - name: anchor-example-3
    <<: *defaults
    url: "https://twin.sh/health"
    conditions:                # This will override the conditions defined in &defaults
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].status == UP"
```
</details>

### Proxy client configuration

You can configure a proxy for the client to use by setting the `proxy-url` parameter in the client configuration.

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: website
    url: "https://twin.sh/health"
    client:
      proxy-url: http://proxy.example.com:8080
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

### How to fix 431 Request Header Fields Too Large error
Depending on where your environment is deployed and what kind of middleware or reverse proxy sits in front of Gatus,
you may run into this issue. This could be because the request headers are too large, e.g. big cookies.

By default, `web.read-buffer-size` is set to `8192`, but increasing this value like so will increase the read buffer size:
```yaml
web:
  read-buffer-size: 32768
```


### Badges
#### Uptime
![Uptime 1h](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/uptimes/1h/badge.svg)
![Uptime 24h](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/uptimes/24h/badge.svg)
![Uptime 7d](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/uptimes/7d/badge.svg)

Gatus can automatically generate an SVG badge for one of your monitored endpoints.
This allows you to put badges in your individual applications' README or even create your own status page if you
desire.

The path to generate a badge is the following:
```
/api/v1/endpoints/{key}/uptimes/{duration}/badge.svg
```
Where:
- `{duration}` is `7d`, `24h` or `1h`
- `{key}` has the pattern `<GROUP_NAME>_<ENDPOINT_NAME>` in which both variables have ` `, `/`, `_`, `,` and `.` replaced by `-`.

For instance, if you want the uptime during the last 24 hours from the endpoint `frontend` in the group `core`,
the URL would look like this:
```
https://example.com/api/v1/endpoints/core_frontend/uptimes/7d/badge.svg
```
If you want to display an endpoint that is not part of a group, you must leave the group value empty:
```
https://example.com/api/v1/endpoints/_frontend/uptimes/7d/badge.svg
```
Example:
```
![Uptime 24h](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/uptimes/24h/badge.svg)
```
If you'd like to see a visual example of each badge available, you can simply navigate to the endpoint's detail page.


#### Health
![Health](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/health/badge.svg)

The path to generate a badge is the following:
```
/api/v1/endpoints/{key}/health/badge.svg
```
Where:
- `{key}` has the pattern `<GROUP_NAME>_<ENDPOINT_NAME>` in which both variables have ` `, `/`, `_`, `,` and `.` replaced by `-`.

For instance, if you want the current status of the endpoint `frontend` in the group `core`,
the URL would look like this:
```
https://example.com/api/v1/endpoints/core_frontend/health/badge.svg
```


#### Health (Shields.io)
![Health](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatus.twin.sh%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fendpoints%2Fcore_blog-external%2Fhealth%2Fbadge.shields)

The path to generate a badge is the following:
```
/api/v1/endpoints/{key}/health/badge.shields
```
Where:
- `{key}` has the pattern `<GROUP_NAME>_<ENDPOINT_NAME>` in which both variables have ` `, `/`, `_`, `,` and `.` replaced by `-`.

For instance, if you want the current status of the endpoint `frontend` in the group `core`,
the URL would look like this:
```
https://example.com/api/v1/endpoints/core_frontend/health/badge.shields
```

See more information about the Shields.io badge endpoint [here](https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge).


#### Response time
![Response time 1h](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/response-times/1h/badge.svg)
![Response time 24h](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/response-times/24h/badge.svg)
![Response time 7d](https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-external/response-times/7d/badge.svg)

The endpoint to generate a badge is the following:
```
/api/v1/endpoints/{key}/response-times/{duration}/badge.svg
```
Where:
- `{duration}` is `7d`, `24h` or `1h`
- `{key}` has the pattern `<GROUP_NAME>_<ENDPOINT_NAME>` in which both variables have ` `, `/`, `_`, `,` and `.` replaced by `-`.


##### How to change the color thresholds of the response time badge
To change the response time badges' threshold, a corresponding configuration can be added to an endpoint.
The values in the array correspond to the levels [Awesome, Great, Good, Passable, Bad]
All five values must be given in milliseconds (ms).

```
endpoints:
- name: nas
  group: internal
  url: "https://example.org/"
  interval: 5m
  conditions:
    - "[STATUS] == 200"
  ui:
    badge:
      response-time:
        thresholds: [550, 850, 1350, 1650, 1750]
```


### API
Gatus provides a simple read-only API that can be queried in order to programmatically determine endpoint status and history.

All endpoints are available via a GET request to the following endpoint:
```
/api/v1/endpoints/statuses
````
Example: https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/statuses

Specific endpoints can also be queried by using the following pattern:
```
/api/v1/endpoints/{group}_{endpoint}/statuses
```
Example: https://status.twin.sh/api/v1/endpoints/core_blog-home/statuses

Gzip compression will be used if the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header contains `gzip`.

The API will return a JSON payload with the `Content-Type` response header set to `application/json`.
No such header is required to query the API.


### Installing as binary
You can download Gatus as a binary using the following command:
```
go install github.com/TwiN/gatus/v5@latest
```
