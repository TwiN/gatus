A service health dashboard in Go that is meant to be used as a docker 
image with a custom configuration file.

I personally deploy it in my Kubernetes cluster and have it monitor the status of my
core applications: https://status.twinnation.org/

## Features

The main features of Gatus are:
- **Highly flexible health check conditions**: While checking the response status may be enough for some use cases, Gatus goes much further and allows you to add conditions on the response time, the response body and even the IP address.
- **Ability to use Gatus for user acceptance tests**: Thanks to the point above, you can leverage this application to create automated user acceptance tests.
- **Very easy to configure**: Not only is the configuration designed to be as readable as possible, it's also extremely easy to add a new service or a new endpoint to monitor.
- **Alerting**: While having a pretty visual dashboard is useful to keep track of the state of your application(s), you probably don't want to stare at it all day. Thus, notifications via Slack are supported out of the box with the ability to configure a custom alerting provider for any needs you might have, whether it be a different provider like PagerDuty or a custom application that manages automated rollbacks. 
- **Metrics**
- **Low resource consumption**: As with most Go applications, the resource footprint that this application requires is negligibly small.


## Usage

By default, the configuration file is expected to be at `config/config.yaml`.

You can specify a custom path by setting the `GATUS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

Here's a simple example:

```yaml
metrics: true         # Whether to expose metrics at /metrics
services:
  - name: twinnation  # Name of your service, can be anything
    url: "https://twinnation.org/health"
    interval: 30s     # Duration to wait between every status check (default: 60s)
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"         # Status must be 200
      - "[BODY].status == UP"     # The json path "$.status" must be equal to UP
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"   # Response time must be under 300ms
  - name: example
    url: "https://example.org/"
    interval: 30s
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
```

This example would look like this:

Note that you can also add environment variables in the your configuration file (i.e. `$DOMAIN`, `${DOMAIN}`)

## Docker

Building the Docker image is done as following:

```
docker build . -t gatus
```

You can then run the container with the following command:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name gatus gatus
```


## Running the tests

```
go test ./... -mod vendor
```


## Using in Production

## FAQ

### Sending a GraphQL request

By setting `services[].graphql` to true, the body will automatically be wrapped by the standard GraphQL `query` parameter.

For instance, the following configuration:
```yaml
services:
  - name: filter users by gender
    url: http://localhost:8080/playground
    method: POST
    graphql: true
    body: |
      {
        user(gender: "female") {
          id
          name
          gender
          avatar
        }
      }
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].data.user[0].gender == female"
```

will send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8080/playground` with the following body:
```json
{"query":"      {\n        user(gender: \"female\") {\n          id\n          name\n          gender\n          avatar\n        }\n      }"}
```


### Configuring Slack alerts

```yaml
alerting:
  slack: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/**********/**********/**********"
services:
  - name: twinnation
    interval: 30s
    url: "https://twinnation.org/health"
    alerts:
      - type: slack
        enabled: true
        description: "healthcheck failed 3 times in a row"
      - type: slack
        enabled: true
        threshold: 5
        description: "healthcheck failed 5 times in a row"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].status == UP"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"
```

### Configuring Twilio alerts

```yaml
alerting:
  twilio:
    sid: ****
    token: ****
    from: +1-234-567-8901
    to: +1-234-567-8901
services:
  - name: twinnation
    interval: 30s
    url: "https://twinnation.org/health"
    alerts:
      - type: twilio
        enabled: true
        description: "healthcheck failed 3 times in a row"
      - type: twilio
        enabled: true
        threshold: 5
        description: "healthcheck failed 5 times in a row"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].status == UP"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"
```


### Configuring custom alerts

While they're called alerts, you can use this feature to call anything. 

For instance, you could automate rollbacks by having an application that keeps tracks of new deployments, and by 
leveraging Gatus, you could have Gatus call that application endpoint when a service starts failing. Your application
would then check if the service that started failing was recently deployed, and if it was, then automatically 
roll it back.

The values `[ALERT_DESCRIPTION]` and `[SERVICE_NAME]` are automatically substituted for the alert description and the 
service name respectively in the body (`alerting.custom.body`) and the url (`alerting.custom.url`).

For all intents and purpose, we'll configure the custom alert with a Slack webhook, but you can call anything you want.

```yaml
alerting:
  custom:
    url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/**********/**********/**********"
    method: "POST"
    body: |
      {
        "text": "[SERVICE_NAME] - [ALERT_DESCRIPTION]"
      }
services:
  - name: twinnation
    interval: 30s
    url: "https://twinnation.org/health"
    alerts:
      - type: custom
        enabled: true
        threshold: 10
        description: "healthcheck failed 10 times in a row"
    conditions:
      - "[STATUS] == 200"
      - "[BODY].status == UP"
      - "[RESPONSE_TIME] < 300"
```
