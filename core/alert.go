	// This value should only be modified if the provider.AlertProvider's Send function does not return an error for an
	// alert that hasn't been triggered yet. This doubles as a lazy retry. The reason why this behavior isn't also
	// applied for alerts that are already triggered and has become "healthy" again is to prevent a case where, for
	// some reason, the alert provider always returns errors when trying to send the resolved notification
	// (SendOnResolved).
