//    We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
//    variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.
//
// 	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
// 	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
// 	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
// 	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
// 	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
// 	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
// 	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long
//
//    We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
//    conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
//    types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
//    This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
//    these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
//    make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
//    we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
//    compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
//    and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
//    program's portability.
//
//    Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
//    we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
//    and int is always 32 bits.

// ISO C Standard:  7.17  Common definitions  <stddef.h>

// Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc
//    wants us just to define one data type.  So don't define
//    the symbols that indicate this file's entire job has been done.

// This avoids lossage on SunOS but only if stdtypes.h comes first.
//    There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.

// On 4.3bsd-net2, make sure ansi.h is included, so we have
//    one less case to deal with in the following.
// On FreeBSD 5, machine/ansi.h does not exist anymore...

// In 4.3bsd-net2, machine/ansi.h defines these symbols, which are
//    defined if the corresponding type is *not* defined.
//    FreeBSD-2.1 defines _MACHINE_ANSI_H_ instead of _ANSI_H_.
//    NetBSD defines _I386_ANSI_H_ and _X86_64_ANSI_H_ instead of _ANSI_H_

// Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
//    Just ignore it.

// On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
//    _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
//    vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
//    not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
//    If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
//    invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.

// In case nobody has defined these types, but we aren't running under
//    GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
//    __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
//    parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
//    include gstddef.h, such as collect2.

// Signed type of difference of two pointers.

// Define this type if we are doing the whole job,
//    or if we want this type in particular.

// Unsigned type of `sizeof' something.

// Define this type if we are doing the whole job,
//    or if we want this type in particular.

// Wide character type.
//    Locale-writers should change this as necessary to
//    be big enough to hold unique values not between 0 and 127,
//    and not (wchar_t) -1, for each defined multibyte character.

// Define this type if we are doing the whole job,
//    or if we want this type in particular.

//  In 4.3bsd-net2, leave these undefined to indicate that size_t, etc.
//     are already defined.
//  BSD/OS 3.1 and FreeBSD [23].x require the MACHINE_ANSI_H check here.

//    __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_T  - size of pthread_rwlockattr_t.
//    __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T     - size of pthread_barrier_t.
//    __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_T - size of pthread_barrierattr_t.
//
//    Also, the following macros must be define for internal pthread_mutex_t
//    struct definitions (struct __pthread_mutex_s):
//
//    __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_MID   - any additional members after 'kind'
// 				    and before '__spin' (for 64 bits) or
// 				    '__nusers' (for 32 bits).
//    __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_END   - any additional members at the end of
// 				    the internal structure.
//    __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION   - 1 if the architecture supports lock
// 				    elision or 0 otherwise.
//    __PTHREAD_MUTEX_NUSERS_AFTER_KIND - control where to put __nusers.  The
// 				       preferred value for new architectures
// 				       is 0.
//    __PTHREAD_MUTEX_USE_UNION      - control whether internal __spins and
// 				    __list will be place inside a union for
// 				    linuxthreads compatibility.
// 				    The preferred value for new architectures
// 				    is 0.
//
//    For a new port the preferred values for the required defines are:
//
//    #define __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_MID
//    #define __PTHREAD_COMPAT_PADDING_END
//    #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION         0
//    #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_NUSERS_AFTER_KIND    0
//    #define __PTHREAD_MUTEX_USE_UNION            0
//
//    __PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK_ELISION can be set to 1 if the hardware plans to
//    eventually support lock elision using transactional memory.
//
//    The additional macro defines any constraint for the lock alignment
//    inside the thread structures:
//
//    __LOCK_ALIGNMENT - for internal lock/futex usage.
//
//    Same idea but for the once locking primitive:
//
//    __ONCE_ALIGNMENT - for pthread_once_t/once_flag definition.
//
//    And finally the internal pthread_rwlock_t (struct __pthread_rwlock_arch_t)
//    must be defined.
