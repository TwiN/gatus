## Configuring Gatus through the GATUS_CONFIG environment variable

If you want to configure Gatus from an environment variable rather than from a file, you can use GATUS_CONFIG.
Just insert a valid configuration into the environment variable.
The docker-compose file provided shows an example. 
You will need to minify the YAML configuration. This can be done using online YAML-minifer services.
